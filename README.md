======

This is a simulator for continuous-wave Time-of-Flight sensors, specifically
PMD sensors.

It implements the illumination and sensor models described in this paper:
M. Lambers, S. Hoberg, A. Kolb: [Simulation of Time-of-Flight Sensors for Evaluation of
Chip Layout Variants](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&arnumber=7054461).
In IEEE Sensors Journal, 15(7), 2015, pages 4019-4026.

This software was developed at the [Computer Graphics Group, University of
Siegen](http://www.cg.informatik.uni-siegen.de),
in collaboration with [pmdtec](http://pmdtec.com).

An overview including building and installation instructions is available in
[src/README.txt](https://github.com/marlam/pmdsim/blob/master/src/README.txt),
in doxygen format.
